Started working on Oil & Gas industry going to Offshore Rig for 3 years them I would like more technical challenges, so move to Geoscience Team, where I could work with many expertise and support important decision for 10 years. 

During my first Geoscience Training I went to Houston-Texas, and come back to Brazil with my first MacBook Air and the first contact with iOS, Xcode world began. I was excited with making apps using Objective-C, as I learned C/C++ on the University, was great nostalgia. Was 10 years divided between Geoscience and iOS developer, Stanford Course and WWDC every year.

Until on this year, I accept new challenge, move to London-UK.  So I decided, is time to move to iOS Developer, so I having been study and practice as never before, doing many courses.
